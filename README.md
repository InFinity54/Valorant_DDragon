## Introduction
_Data Dragon_ is a package of files you can use for your projects about [_Valorant_](https://playvalorant.com), distributed by Riot Games. A new version of _Data Dragon_ is released some days after each game update. This repository allows you to update automatically all files more easily.

Don't forget that new patchs will be added right after their release on Riot Games' Developers website, but it takes often many days to come.

## Notes about this repository
This repository will only regroup all patchs released after, and including, patch 3.00, because Riot didn't release any static data about the game before the 3.00 patch.
